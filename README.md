Connecting science and technology with sport

If you want to achive change you must get power.Objectively know what you do, to control what you get, don't let things happen to you, make things happen.
Be stronger at any weight.

We understand that power is the only way to achieve change. Objectively know what you do, to control what you get. Be stronger at any weight

STUDIES THAT CONFIRM RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VELOCITY AND %RM
Movement Velocity as a Measure of Loading Intensity in Resistance Training
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41549227_Movement_Velocity_as_a_Measure_of_Loading_Intensity_in_Resistance_Training
There's a load-velocity relationship regardless of individual relative strength. These results confirm an inextricable relationshipbetween relative load and MPV:

1) evaluate maximal strength without the need to perform a 1RM test, or test of maximum number of repetitions to failure (XRM)
2) determine the %1RM that is being used as soon as the first repetition with any given load is performed
3) prescribe and monitor training load according to velocity, instead of percentages of 1RM or XRM.

STUDIES THAT CONFIRM RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VELOCITY LOSS AND FATIGUE
Effect of loading on unintentional lifting velocity declines during single sets of repetitions to failure during upper and lower extremity muscle actions.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16944400
While average repetition velocity was recorded, a pattern of reduciton in the average velocity achieved during each repetition
was found.
This pattern of average velocity reduction indicates that for a given muscle action fatigue develops between each rep in a
given set in the form of velocity loss

Velocity Loss as a Variable for Monitoring Resistance Exercise
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313686918_Velocity_Loss_as_a_Variable_for_Monitoring_Resistance_Exercise
There is a very close relationship was found between the relative loss of velocity in a set and the percentage of performed repetitions. Moreover, the percentage of performed repetitions for a given velocity loss showed a high absolute reliability. 

Movement velocity as a measure of level of effort during resistance exercise
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318150104_Movement_velocity_as_a_measure_of_level_of_effort_during_resistance_exercise
By monitoring repetition velocity one can estimate with high accuracy the proximity of muscle failure and, therefore, to more objectively quantify the level of effort and fatigue being incurred during resistance training.

STUDIES THAT CONFIRM DIFFERENT FATIGUE PERCENTAGES TO GAINS STRENGTH
RESEARCHED APPLICATIONS OF VELOCITY BASED STRENGTH TRAINING
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5f96/79c3f0f2d34478121d7cc33a50eb84dafb7a.pdf
minimizing velocity loss to an inferior to 20 percent can positively influence muscular strength, velocity losses of 35 percent an more can increase metabolites which
might produce longer recovery times


STUDIES THAT CONFIRM LIFTING AT MAX INTENDED SPEED PROVIDES BETTER ADAPTATIONS
Maximal intended velocity training induces greater gains in bench press performance than deliberately slower half-velocity training.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24734902
Lifting a given weight at maximum intended velocity provides significantly greater strength gains.
Strength gains can be maximised when repetitions are performed at maximal intended velocity
